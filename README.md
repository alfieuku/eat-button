# eat-button


1. Users set location and pick cuisine in corner; no sign up; minimal onboarding
2. Big red flashy button when app opens
3. After button selection->ask for confirmation or press again
4. If confirmed->open location in apple maps
5. That's literally it. Made for personal reasons so I can be more decisive about food.
